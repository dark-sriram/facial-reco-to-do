# 🔧 Face Recognition Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "No face detected" Error

**Possible Causes:**
- Poor lighting conditions
- Face not centered in camera
- Camera permissions not granted
- Face too far from camera
- Multiple faces in frame

**Solutions:**
1. **Improve Lighting:**
   - Ensure you're facing a light source
   - Avoid backlighting (light behind you)
   - Use natural daylight when possible

2. **Camera Position:**
   - Center your face in the camera frame
   - Keep face 1-2 feet from camera
   - Look directly at the camera
   - Remove glasses if causing reflection

3. **Browser Permissions:**
   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Check browser settings for camera permissions
   - Try refreshing the page

4. **Test Face Detection:**
   - Use the "Test Face Detection" button first
   - This will tell you if your face is being detected

### 2. "Models are still loading" Error

**Possible Causes:**
- Slow internet connection
- CDN issues
- Browser blocking external resources

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for Models:**
   - Models can take 10-30 seconds to load
   - Check the status indicator at the bottom

2. **Check Internet:**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Browser Issues:**
   - Disable ad blockers temporarily
   - Try incognito/private mode
   - Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### 3. "Registration failed" Error

**Possible Causes:**
- Backend server not running
- Database connection issues
- Network connectivity problems

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Backend:**
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 5000
   - Check console for server errors

2. **Database:**
   - Verify MongoDB connection
   - Check database credentials

3. **Network:**
   - Ensure frontend can reach backend
   - Check for firewall blocking

### 4. Camera Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
- Camera in use by another application
- Browser permissions denied
- Hardware issues

**Solutions:**
1. **Close Other Apps:**
   - Close other video calling apps
   - Close other browser tabs using camera

2. **Browser Permissions:**
   - Click the camera icon in address bar
   - Allow camera access
   - Refresh the page

3. **Hardware Check:**
   - Test camera in other applications
   - Try a different browser

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check Status Indicators
Look at the bottom of the login screen:
- ✅ Models Loaded - Models are ready
- ⏳ Loading Models - Wait for completion
- ✅ Camera Ready - Camera is accessible
- ❌ Camera Not Ready - Fix camera issues

### Step 2: Test Face Detection
1. Click "Test Face Detection" button
2. Check console for detailed logs
3. Ensure only one face is detected

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for error messages
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Step 4: Verify Backend
1. Open http://localhost:5000/api/users in browser
2. Should see API endpoint (may show error, that's normal)
3. Check backend console for logs

## Browser Compatibility

### Recommended Browsers:
- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)
- ⚠️ Safari (may have issues)

### Required Features:
- WebRTC support
- Camera API access
- ES6 modules support
- WebAssembly support

## Performance Tips

### For Better Face Detection:
1. **Lighting:** Face a window or light source
2. **Distance:** Stay 1-2 feet from camera
3. **Angle:** Face camera directly
4. **Background:** Use plain background
5. **Stability:** Keep head still during capture

### For Faster Loading:
1. **Internet:** Use stable, fast connection
2. **Browser:** Close unnecessary tabs
3. **Cache:** Clear browser cache if issues persist
